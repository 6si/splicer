ETL
=========

ETL stands for Extract, Transform, Load. It's a term most
commonly used in the data warehousing world. If you have
ever written a script that parses a file (Extract); cleaned
up the values in it, perhaps fixing up the date strings, (Transform)
and then inserted the results into another database (Load) then
you've written an ETL script.
